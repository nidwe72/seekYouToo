Abstract

.
 Monte Carlo studies of non-ablian gauge theories emerged in the early eighties
 now establishing a standard tool of modern lattice quantum field theory.
 Due to the dramatic increase of mobile computational power in the 2010s
 it is now possible to carry out very basic simulations on smart phones.
 The author describes an according cross-platform implementation of 
\begin_inset Formula $SU_{2}$
\end_inset

 gluon dynamics and discusses some ditactical aspects.

\begin_layout Standard
Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes the strong interaction of quarks
 and gluons.
 Quarks make up hardons such as the protons and neutron forming themeselves
 the nuclei of atoms.
 Gluons glue together the quarks implementing the strong force.
 Quarks have spin 1/2 and thus are fermions (i.e.
 particles with half odd integer spin) in constrast to gluon carrying spin
 1 and being bosons (particles with integer spin).
 Spin plays an esential statistical role : Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion
 principle stating that two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum
 state simultaneously.
 Thus electrons live in distinct shells around the nuclei of atoms.
 Gluons play the same role as photons, being the carriers of electromagnetic
 force, yet gluons can also interact with themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Electrodynamics describes the electromagnetics fields.
 Historically Gauss, Ampere and Faraday formulated distinct equations for
 the electric and magntics fields, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{E}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The magnetic field has no monopoles and thus divergenceless as expressed
 in Gauss's law 
\begin_inset Formula $\divergence{\vb{B}}=0$
\end_inset

 of the magntic field.
 As the divergence of a curl always vanishes the magnetic field can be written
 as the curl of its potential 
\begin_inset Formula $\vb{B}=\curl{\vb{A}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Faradays law states a changing magnetic fileld induces a voltage in a coil.
 That is the path integral of the electric field around a closed loop equal
 to the negative rate if the change of the magnetic flux through the area
 enclosed by the loop: 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint_{C}\vb{E}\cdot d\vb{r}=-\partial\vb{B}/\partial t$
\end_inset

.
 Put in vector notation we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\curl{\vb{E}}=-\partial\vb{B}/\partial t$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the magnetic potential 
\begin_inset Formula $\vb{A}$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\curl{(\vb{E}+\partial\vb{A}/\partial t)}=0$
\end_inset

.
 When the curl of a vector field vanishes the field can always be written
 as the gradient of a scalar, giving 
\begin_inset Formula $\vb{E}=-\grad{V}-\partial\vb{A}/\partial t$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 being the electric potential.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the electric and magnetic field only depends on the changes of the accordings
 potentials we assume it is possible that we can change the potentials and
 obtains the same fields.
 If we make the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\vb{A}\rightarrow\vb{A}+\grad{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 the magnetic field 
\begin_inset Formula $\vb{B}$
\end_inset

 does not change since the curl of a gradient vanishes, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vb{B}=\curl{\vb{A+\grad{\lambda}}}=\curl{\vb{A}}$
\end_inset

.
 However the electric field is changed, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vb{E}=-\grad{V}-\partial\vb{A}/\partial t-\grad{\partial\lambda/\partial t}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $=-\grad{(V+\partial\lambda/\partial t)}-\partial\vb{A}/\partial t$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If another change 
\begin_inset Formula $V\rightarrow V-\partial\lambda/\partial t$
\end_inset

 is made also 
\begin_inset Formula $\vb{E}$
\end_inset

 remains unchanged.
 A partial choice of the potentials is called a gauge and can be done in
 many ways.

Though the electric potential relates to static charges and the magnetic
 one to moving charges the expressional symmetry of this appealing formulation
 suggests that the distinction between electric and magnetic fields are
 a question about point of view and that the electric and magnetic fields
 form one field, the electromagnetic field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maxwell carried out a relativistic formulation taking into account Lorentz
 (Hendrik) transformations.
 That is, he analysed how the fields transform when changing from a coordinate
 frame in Minkoskian spacetime to some other frame beeing boosted at constant
 velocity relative to the original frame.
 These transformation can be represented by 4x4 real matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 (parametrized by the velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

) such that a transformed spacetime-vector has the same scalar (using the
 Minkowski metric) as the original vector.
 The transfomation of the electric and magnetic field can be written in
 a concise form letting the Lorentz group matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 act on the electromagnetic field tensor
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{\mu\nu}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & -E_{x}/c & -E_{y}/c & -E_{z}/c\\
E_{x}/c & 0 & -B_{z} & B_{y}\\
E_{y}/c & B_{z} & 0 & -B_{x}\\
E_{z}/c & -B_{y} & B_{x} & 0
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the four-vector potential given by 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}=(V/c,A_{x},A_{y},A_{z})$
\end_inset

 and the four-current defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{\nu}=(c\rho,J_{x},J_{y},J_{z})$
\end_inset

 the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation can written in the very compact form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\partial_{\mu}F^{\mu\nu}=\mu_{0}J^{\nu}
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Note that in the 4-notaion greek indices run from 0 to 3 and the Einstein
 summation convention is applied when an index is repeated both lowered
 and raised, that is for two 4-vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\mu}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\mu}Y_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 means 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\mu}Y_{\mu}=\sum_{\mu=0}^{3}X^{\mu}Y_{\mu}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also note that a second order tensor (a matrix) 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 with only lowered indices is called covariant and that according contravariant
 tensor (raised indices) is build by applying the metric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X^{\mu\nu}=\eta^{\mu\alpha}\eta^{\nu\beta}X_{\alpha\beta};\quad\eta^{\mu\nu}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important feature of the 4-vector notation to be mentioned is that the
 product of a contravariant and a covariant tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\mu}X_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is invariant under Lorentz transformation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is easy to show that the Maxwell equation is the Euler-Lagrange equation
 of the Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{L}=\mathscr{{L}}_{field}+\mathscr{{L}}_{interaction}=-\frac{1}{4\mu_{0}}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}-J^{\mu}A_{\mu}.
\]

\begin_layout Subsection*
Gauge theories and symmetries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Noether's theorem states that for every differentiable global symmetry of
 the action of a Lagrangian system there is a corresponding conservation
 law.
 For instance time translations give conversation of energy and spatial
 translations yield conservation of enery.
 If we have for example a a complex-valued scalar field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 being invariant under some 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)$
\end_inset

 transformation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(x)\rightarrow e^{i\alpha}\phi(x)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 does not depend on position 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 one can construct an according conserved Noether current.
 If however we have a position-dependent 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(x)$
\end_inset

 and the Lagrangain involves derivatives we obtain unwanted term destroying
 the invariance, because at each point we have different transformation
 roles.
 In order to have obtain local symmetry we tweak the partial derivative
 introducing a new gauge potential 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}$
\end_inset

: The covariant devirative 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{\mu}=\partial_{\mu}-igA_{\mu}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

eliminates the terms indroduced by the partial derivative, argueing as follows.
 We assume that
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 transforms as 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}\rightarrow A\mu+(1/g)\partial\mu\alpha(x)$
\end_inset

.
 By comparing to the the gauge discussed for the electromegnetic field,
 
\begin_inset Formula $V\rightarrow V-\partial\lambda/\partial t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vb{A}\rightarrow\vb{A}+\grad{\lambda}$
\end_inset

) , we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(x)/g$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 being the coupling constant (being 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 in the case of electrodynamics).
 Using some algebra we see that the covariant derivative applied to the
 phase transformed field together with the gauge transformation gives us
 an expression in which the covariant derivative itself remains does not
 depend on the phase:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
D_{\mu} & \rightarrow & \left[\partial_{\mu}+ig\left(A_{\mu}-\frac{1}{g}\partial_{\mu}\alpha(x)\right)\right]e^{i\alpha(x)}\phi=\\
 & = & e^{i\alpha(x)}\partial_{\mu}\phi\\
 &  & +ie^{i\alpha(x)}\phi\partial_{\mu}\alpha(x)+igA_{\mu}e^{i\alpha(x)}\phi\\
 &  & -ie^{i\alpha(x)}\phi\partial_{\mu}\alpha(x)\\
 & = & e^{i\alpha(x)}\left(\partial_{\mu}-igA_{\mu}\right)\phi\\
 & = & e^{i\alpha(x)}D_{\mu}\phi
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 transforms the same way as the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 it is the name

covariant

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using covariant derivatives we can thus construct meaningful Lagrangians
 preserving local symmetry.
 The simple real gauge theory is quantum electrodynamics (QED) augmenting
 electrodynamics by fermions (for instance electrons) described by Dirac
 spinors 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathscr{{L}} & = & \mathscr{{L}}_{Dirac}+\mathscr{{L}}_{Maxwell}+\mathscr{{L}}_{interaction}\\
 & = & \bar{\psi}\left(i\gamma^{\mu}\partial\mu-m\right)\psi-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}-e\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi A_{\mu}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Using the covariant derivative the Lagrangian reads
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathscr{{L}}=\bar{\psi}\left(i\gamma^{\mu}D_{\mu}-m\right)\psi-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
\]

\end_inset

and one obtains as the equation of motions for the fermionic wave function
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and the electromagnetic potential 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left(i\gamma^{\mu}D_{\mu}-m\right)\psi & = & 0\\
\partial_{\mu}F^{\mu\nu} & = & e\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\nu}\psi
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The symmetry group of QED is 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)$
\end_inset

, that is the Lagrangian is invariant under 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\rightarrow e^{i\alpha(x)}\psi$
\end_inset

 and the according gauge field is the electromagnetic potential.

 involved case that the groups in question are non-abelian.
